# CIFAR10 Image Classification
CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for image  classification tasks that consists of 50,000 32x32  colour images in 10 classes. The classes include  common objects such as airplanes, cars, birds,  cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.  The task is to train a neural network to correctly  classify these images into their respective classes.  In this assignment, we will build a neural network  model on training dataset and evaluate it on test  set.
